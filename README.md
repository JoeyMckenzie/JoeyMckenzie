### Hi, I'm Joey 👋

I'm a developer based in Northern California, husband, dog dad, fantasy football try-hard, and beer snob among other things.

### Writing ✍️ 

I write fairly regularly on my personal blog [joeymckenzie.tech](https://joeymckenzie.tech). If you're interested in terrible opinions about software development, check it out!

### Work 💸

I'm a Senior Software Engineer at National Funding, a fintech company based in San Diego. I'm a TypeScript & .NET dev/amateur DevOps hopeful by day, and a rustacean off the clock. 🦀
