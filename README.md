### Hi, I'm Joey.

I'm a developer based in Northern California. I'm also a husband, dad (both to humans and dogs), fantasy football try-hard, and beer snob among other things. I write fairly regularly on my personal blog [joeymckenzie.tech](https://joeymckenzie.tech). Mostly good stuff, sometimes questionable takes on software. I'm a Senior Software Engineer at Dayforce. I'm mostly a .NET'er these days and PHP enjoyer off the clock.
